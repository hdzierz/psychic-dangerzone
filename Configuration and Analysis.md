## Impacts of Configuration and Analysis Burden on PFR Impacts


In order to contribute to decision-making concerning support for alternative desktop options for PFR developer/scientist/analysts, it is desirable to discuss the status quo and what is possible. This document is intended to provide some background to the experience  of being on the frontline with data anaysis in PFR.

We view our primary role as one of delivering, or contributing to delivery of impacts and value to clients through processing data to insights, actionable information or services. We argue that PFR IT policy and infrastructure must support contemporary best practices for development and analysis to ensure we are competitive providers of research in NZ and abroad. 

We acknowledge that supporting standard OS and desktop provides many advantages for support. It is also worth noting that many businesses have shifted to cloud-based offerings such as those provided by Google for 'standard' office functionality. In a time when virtualization and cloud computing can provide the ability to create or outsource generic infrastructure needs, cost-effectiveness of our IT spend in relation to competitors must be open to debate. Our priority is to develop solutions, not infrastructure. 




Thanks to the internet, it is nowadays straightforward to identity best practices for development and deployment of scientific computing analyses and environments. There is an overwhelming trend toward these being based on unix-like operating systems, open-source languages like R, Python and Java, managed through source control systems notably Git, and deployed on virtual and/or containerized environments on local or cloud hosts. Commercial offerings are emerging for to support these approaches through secure platform-as-a-service hosting and other support options. 

The current Windows-centric IT policy places the burden for configuration and maintenance onto analysts and developers. This has led to an array of 'shadow-IT' solutions, but our future is not workarounds. Our future is connectedness, but the current division between our windows desktop and linux-based computing infrastructure and practice is deep and very hard to bridge. This is currently limiting progress in upskilling staff and building solutions for the following reasons we have previously outlined:

1. The absence of a useful Posix-compliant shell on Windows. 
2. Authentication issues
3. Absence of any modern shell or scripting languages on windows

Since 2000 there has been a noticeable decline in the suitability of the windows operating system for scientific computing. The suggestion of windows and Geneious being a 'standard platform' for DFI researchers is interesting. Anecdotal evidence from BioMatters Geneious developer  Shane Sturrock indicates that the proportion of  Windows licenses they sell has been in  steady decline over the past few years.
