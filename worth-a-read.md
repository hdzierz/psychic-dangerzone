# software updates and adoption rates

Adoption appears difficult to define. There are more Windows devices 

 * [Android](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) vs [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/)
    + [commentary](http://www.zdnet.com/article/android-lollipop-is-out-but-almost-no-one-is-using-it/)
 * [Windows](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2602469/heres-what-free-upgrades-could-do-for-windows-9s-uptake.html) and [Windows 8](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2100422/windows-8-may-be-selling-but-different-figures-define-its-use.html) the second link offers some interesting points.
 * [OS X Yosemite](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2853636/os-x-yosemite-sets-mac-adoption-record.html) and [Mavericks](http://www.tekrevue.com/windows-8-outpaces-os-x-mavericks/) [40 million](http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/02/apples-wwdc-2014-in-numbers-40-million-on-mavericks-and-more/) which appears to quote NetApplication's [view of the world](http://www.netmarketshare.com) that is different from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_table) and [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp) when is comes to browsers.

# other analysis

```
Microsoft now embraces an “any device” policy and is delivering keys apps like Office
for Apple and (soon) Android devices, accepting the decline in the Windows client.

```
Apple laptops had replaced Windows laptops as the code jockey’s steed of choice,
with the very act of programming itself having become decoupled from the client's
operating system. It was said, and it was written, how Microsoft had lost a 
generation of developers.
